## Overview

In the folder "snRNA-seq analysis", we preprocessed, integrated, and annotated single-cell multiome (RNA+ATAC) data from healthy and Alzheimer's disease samples. 

In the folder "Spatial_transcriptomics_analysis", we investigated **PLCG2 gene expression** across spatial transcriptomics data from matched Alzheimer's disease samples, excluding control spots. It includes integration of pathology annotations, data scaling, violin plot visualization, and statistical testing.
